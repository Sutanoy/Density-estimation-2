# Density-estimation-2
Geometric framework for nonparametric conditional density estimation

The file for conditional density estimaion(cde) with 1 predictor is univariatecde.m. It calls locallinearreg.m for employing local linear regression to compute the mean function for the initial estimate
The file for cde with 2 predictors is bivariatecde.m. It calls locallinearregbivariate.m to compute bivariate local linear regression to compute initial mean function.

Each of the functions for cde calls the function formwteddensityregressionMh.m to compute the unpenalized log likelihood objective function used to obtain the conditional density estimate at a prespecified point. The point has to be specified in the functions univariatecde/bivariatecde, as the case. The function formwteddensityregressionMh.m itself calls the function FormGammaFromC.m to obtain the \gamma from its corresponding tangent space representation.

laprnd.m is a file downloaded from Fileexchange online. It is used to generate samples from Laplace distribution. The author is Elvis Chen. The link to the file is https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/13705-laplacian-random-number-generator

gestationdata.mat is the data studied in Longnecker(2001), testgest.m performs the data analysis with 1 predictor. testgestbivariate.m performs the analysis with 2 predictors.
